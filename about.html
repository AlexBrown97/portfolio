    <p class="paragraph">
      When I discovered that software development was an industry that managed
      to combine both creativity with logic, flair with problem solving and
      artistry with structure, it was clear that this was the career for me.
      After graduating with a degree in English Literature and Theatre Studies,
      I directed my creativity towards a different industry and saw myself
      transition from theatre maker, to software maker. <br /><br />
      I took this leap by enrolling onto Northcoders: an award-winning intensive
      coding bootcamp in full stack software development. I saw this as an
      opportunity to not only better my skill set and introduce me to a new
      industry, but also as a chance to really challenge myself by tackling
      something I had never done before. The risk paid off, as I am now
      regularly making front-end and back-end projects as a student at
      Northcoders, as well as implementing practices like Test Driven
      Development (TDD), paired and mob programming and version control with
      Github.
