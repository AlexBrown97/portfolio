    <p class="about">Hi, I'm Alex Brown - a software developer in training with a passion for all things creative!<br>
    When I discovered that software development was an industry that managed to combine both creativity with logic, flair with problem solving and artistry with structure, 
    it was clear that this was the career for me. After graduating with a degree in English Literature and Theatre Studies, 
    I directed my creativity towards a different industry and saw myself transition from theatre maker, to software maker: 
    a leap that I continue to find exceptionally rewarding<br>Feel free to take a look around!</p>
